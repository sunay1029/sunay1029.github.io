<p style ="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Apple just announced their new product called the"Apple Vision Pro" which is a VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (agumented reality) mixed headset
.The headset is the newest addition to the "Apple Ecosystem",it is said to change your room into a first person expirince.But does the cutting edge technolgy justify for the mind
 boggling price of 3,499$ compared to itÂ´s competion the Meta Quest 3 at 500$, although Meta Quest is very different in fetures that is 3000 $ more or 700% increase.But we can only see if will justify for it`s price.
