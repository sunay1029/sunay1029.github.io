.			The headset is the newest addition to the "Apple Ecosystem",it is said to change your room into a first person expirince.But does the cutting edge technolgy justify for the mind
			boggling price of 3,499$ compared to itÂ´s competion the Meta Quest 3 at 500$, although Meta Quest is very different in fetures that is 3000
			$ more or 700% increase.But we can only see if will justify for it`s price.<h1/>
